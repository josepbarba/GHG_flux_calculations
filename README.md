# GHG_flux_calculations
This script was created by @josepbarba, with inputs from Rafael Poyatos (@rafapoyatos) and Victor Granda (@MalditoBarbudo) (CREAF) and Nezha Acil (@N-Acil) (University of Birmingham)

This R script calculates linear and exponential fluxes from gas concentrations measured with gas analysers. It was created for calculated CO2 and CH4 stem fluxes from Los Gatos Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer for an stem flux study ("Spatiotemporal variability and origin of CO2 and CH4 tree stem fluxes in an upland forest" by Josep Barba, Rafael Poyatos, Margaret Capooci and Rodrigo Vargas; Global Change Biology 2021).
We are going to modify it to make it suitable for other gas analysers. Coments and imputs welcome!
